PHP Framework
====================================

The idea behind the group is for project representatives to talk about the
commonalities between our projects and find ways we can work together. Our main
audience is each other, but we’re very aware that the rest of the PHP community
is watching. If other folks want to adopt what we’re doing they are welcome to
do so, but that is not the aim.

Usage
------------

 1. If you notice something missing, please [open an issue on GitHub][issue].

 2. If you'd like to fix it yourself, simply [edit the file on GitHub][edit] and
    open a pull request. The site will be recompiled as soon as your pull
    request is merged.

 3. If you'd like to test things out locally, you'll need to install Jekyll and
    a markdown engine:
     
    ```bash
    gem install bundler
    bundle install
    ```

    Then compile!

    ```bash
    bundle exec jekyll serve
    ```

    ... and open `http://localhost:4000` in your browser to check it out!
